# Bangla Sign Language Recognition System

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a real-time recognition system for Bangla Sign Language (BSL) using hand gestures. The system employs MediaPipe Hands for detecting and tracking hand landmarks, OpenCV for processing the video feed and extracting features, and TensorFlow (with Keras) for classifying the gestures. This project not only recognizes individual Bangla alphabets and sentences but also interprets mathematical calculations using Bangla numbers, making it a versatile tool for communication assistance for people with hearing impairments.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for development.
- **MediaPipe**: A framework used for detecting hand landmarks and gestures in real-time.
- **OpenCV**: A library for video processing and feature extraction.
- **TensorFlow (Keras)**: Used for building and training the machine learning model to classify the gestures.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computing and handling data arrays.
- **PIL (Pillow)**: Used for drawing text and other elements in the output interface.

## Key Features
- Real-time sign language recognition for Bangla alphabets and numbers.
- Mathematical calculations based on Bangla number gestures.
- Dynamic, real-time interface for user interaction.
- Accessible for people with hearing impairments, providing a bridge for communication.

## Installation
To run the system, you need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install mediapipe opencv-python tensorflow numpy pillow cvzone
